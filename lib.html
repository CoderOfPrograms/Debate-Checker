Professionals typically consider methods used by “abled” person of the same age, sex, and cultural and social environment to accomplish a task to be normal, and all other methods to be abnormal. A problem with this interpretation of disability is the duality of categorization. People are either “disabled” or “abled.” “Abled” persons set the criteria for the categorization, and “abled” persons make the judgments that assign people to one of the two categories. The label “disabled” implies inadequacy as a person. The social meaning of a classification often more strongly influences the daily life of a labeled person than the characteristics that cause the person to meet the classification criteria. When a label carries positive social meaning, the labeled individual may experience expanded opportunities. When the label carries negative social meaning, opportunities often contract. The label “disabled” carries negative social meaning. In the United States, the authors of the ADA recognized the seriousness of the negative consequences of being thought of as “disabled.” The ADA protects persons thought of as “disabled” equally to persons who otherwise meet the criteria for disability under the act. Few other countries have enacted laws to address disadvantage that results from simply being called “disabled.”");

Hence, although increasingly recognised as attributable to social causes also,42 the term 'impairment' refers to individually based functional limitations -whether physical, intellectual sensory or hidden -but' disability' 'is the loss or limitation of opportunities to take part in the normal life of the community on an equal level with others due to physical and social barriers'.43 This shift of emphasis not only makes the problem of terminology much simpler, but also identifies the main cause of disability -a highly discriminatory society which penalises those who do not conform to able-bodied perceptions of normality. 'Disablism', therefore, refers to prejudice, stereotyping, or 'institutional discrimination' against disabled people. It also means that the phrase 'people with disabilities' is incorrect - people have impairments, they do not have disabilities. Additionally, though the tendency to place the noun 'people' before 'disability' is viewed positively because it emphasises the fact that individuals with impairments are in fact people - something which historically has been denied - it has a number of important implications which need to be explained. Firstly, 'people with disabilities' assumes that disability is the property of the individual and not of society. Here the terms 'disabilities' and 'disability' refer to a medical condition; and 'person with a disability' can easily be substituted by 'person with cerebral palsy' or 'person with multiple sclerosis' etc. As we have seen disabled people and their organisations have rejected the implications of the medical model of disability.");

This is because, from the parochial perspective of the medieval inhabitants of remote Alpine valleys, everyone in the world was Christian. Therefore the word became synonymous with \"human being\". Due to the lack of iodine in the medieval Alpine diet, certain regions of Switzerland were prone to severe thyroid problems, which led to more people being born with learning difficulties. Moved by compassion, the local priests encouraged the populace to treat them kindly. They argued that they deserved pity because they were, at least, Christians (i.e. \"human beings\").

Therefore a ‘cripple’ would be one who can only creep. The word is only used once in the King James bible: “and there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked” (Acts 14:8). However it is used a number of times by Shakespeare: “And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp So tediously away.” (Henry V, act IV chorus) The word is still commonly used as an adjective: e.g. “crippling pain”, “crippling debts” and “the health service is crippled”; or as an undesirable fate: “to end up a cripple”. More recently the abbreviated form ‘crip’ has been reclaimed and used by disabled people in the United Kingdom in the same positive way that ‘queer’ was adopted by lesbians and gay men, however it could not be used in that same way by non-disabled people.");

Of course there is nothing inherently wrong with these terms it is simply that their meaning has been substantially devalued by societal perceptions of disabled people; in short, they have been turned into terms of abuse. Their continued use contributes significantly to the negative self-image of disabled people and, at the same time, perpetuates discriminatory attitudes and practices among the general public. In the same way that lesbians, gay men, black people, members of minority ethnic groups and women have identified the power of language in the promotion of heterosexism, homophobia, racism and sexism, so too disabled people are sensitive to the ways in which words cultivate institutional discrimination. Consequently, a major aim of the British Council of Organisations of Disabled People (BCODP) and the disability rights movement in general is the elimination of disablist language in books, in libraries, in schools, and in the media. Therefore, all those who work in the communications media are asked to alert themselves -to unacceptable terminology and refrain from using it. Unfortunately this is not as simple as it sounds because many of the terms commonly used in relation to disability are used interchangeably and mean different things to different people. Much of this confusion stems from definitions of disability devised by non-disabled people who work in official bodies like the Office of Populations Censuses and Surveys and the World Health Organisation. Based on able-bodied assumptions about the experience of disablement these organisations define disability as the relationship between impairment and handicap. 'Impairment' refers to a defective limb, organ or mechanism of the body; 'disability' is the resulting lack of function; and 'handicap' denotes the limitations on daily living which result from disability.Rejected by disabled people and their organisations these meanings individualise and medicalise the problems associated with living with impairment. Their whole focus is on the individual and their perceived inadequacy - restrictive environments and disabling barriers are effectively ignored. They ensure that disabled people are held responsible for any difficulties they encounter during the course of their daily lives.");

By 1865, midget was being used to describe a “very small person”, and by 1884 it referred to small people who were exhibited in freak shows and circuses. Dwarf is of Germanic ancestry, coming ultimately from the proto-Germanic root ‘dhwergwhos’ meaning \"tiny\". In Old English it was ‘dweorg’ and meant \"person of abnormally small stature\". That remained the only meaning until the late 18th century, when, with the influence of German mythology, dwarf came also to mean \"small, manlike creature that lives underground and works metal\" (Crowley and Crowley, 2001).

Midget was formed from the word midge, meaning: \"small fly\", and ‘-et’, so that a midget is etymologyically a \"very small, small fly\". It was first used 1848 in Canada with the meaning \"sand fly\". By 1865, midget was being used to describe a “very small person”, and by 1884 it referred to small people who were exhibited in freak shows and circuses. Dwarf is of Germanic ancestry, coming ultimately from the proto-Germanic root ‘dhwergwhos’ meaning \"tiny\". In Old English it was ‘dweorg’ and meant \"person of abnormally small stature\". That remained the only meaning until the late 18th century, when, with the influence of German mythology, dwarf came also to mean \"small, manlike creature that lives underground and works metal\" (Crowley and Crowley, 2001). It is often used in fairytales such as “Snow White and the Seven Dwarves” and fantasy novels such as “The Lord of the Rings”, often to further the stereotype that disabled people are sinister or evil (Barnes, 1992, page 22) and implying that small people are from a different race. In America people self-identify with the word ‘Dwarf’, however in the U.K. the alternative terms ‘short person’ or ‘person with restricted growth’ are generally used.");
